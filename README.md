## Project Synopsis:

What does it take to save one human life?

Save One Human is a web campaign with a simply premise: to efficiently raise enough donations for the Malaria Consortium (https://www.malariaconsortium.org/) to save one human life.

Most people drastically underestimate how much money it takes to save one human. (https://80000hours.org/2017/05/most-people-report-believing-its-incredibly-cheap-to-save-lives-in-the-developing-world/). Save One Human attempts to cut through the red tape and enable one specific action to help one stranger on this earth.

**Problem Domain** Non-profit charities and the receipt or transfer of money. As SOH has principles of "EASY" and "EFFICIENT", the initial design will link to a third-party donation site. The eventual goal will be to accept donations on the site itself.
